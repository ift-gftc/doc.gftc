title: Certificates
description: This covers how Certificates have been extended including Certificate Types and where Certificates can be added.
---

Certificates were extended in 2 ways. The first way is that Certificate Type was added as a KDE to each certificate to indicate the role in Seafood Traceability that certificate was playing. The next is that the base Object event was extended to allow for a list of Certificates outside of the ILMD data. So that Products could have Certificate information after they have been created.

## Certificate Type

The Certificate Type is specified using the following attribute underneath the `gdst` namespace.
`<gdst:certificationType></gdst:certificationType>`

An example of this in use is as following:
```xml
<cbvmda:certificationList>
        <cbvmda:certification>
            <gdst:certificationType>urn:gdst:certType:harvestCert</gdst:certificationType>
            <cbvmda:certificationStandard>NM6</cbvmda:certificationStandard>
            <cbvmda:certificationAgency>DFO</cbvmda:certificationAgency>
            <cbvmda:certificationValue>SIMP.LPCO.2</cbvmda:certificationValue>
            <cbvmda:certificationIdentification>10161781</cbvmda:certificationIdentification>
      </cbvmda:certification>
</cbvmda:certificationList>
```

## List of Certificate Types

## Object Event Certifications

The base Object event in EPCIS was extended with `<gdst:certificationList></gdst:certificationList>` to allow for certificate to be specified on events that ILMD data is not allowed.
