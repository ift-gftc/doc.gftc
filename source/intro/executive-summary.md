## Overview

The Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability (also referred to as the
Dialogue) is an international, business-to-business platform established
to advance a unified framework for interoperable seafood traceability
practices. The Dialogue brings together a broad spectrum of seafood
industry stakeholders from across different parts of the supply chain,
as well as relevant civil society experts from diverse regions.

The Dialogue is catalysing the development of interoperable practices
that will:

-   Improve the reliability of seafood information

-   Reduce the cost of seafood traceability

-   Contribute to supply chain risk reduction

-   Contribute to securing the long-term social and environmental
    sustainability of the sector.

The Dialogue is organized around a structure and an agenda stemming from
a dozen preparatory workshops in Asia, Europe, and North America. With
three technical working groups, the pre-competitive Dialogue aims to
produce an aligned global framework for seafood traceability based on
four pillars:

1.  Internationally agreed key data elements (KDEs) to be routinely
    associated with seafood products;

2.  Technical specifications for interoperable traceability systems,
    along with standard legal and business formats facilitating
    business-to-business information exchange;

3.  Internationally agreed benchmarks for verifying data validity; and

4.  Harmonisation of business-smart national regulations to help reduce
    compliance burdens.

These four pillars are similar to those that have helped create
interoperable business-to-business traceability and information systems
within other globalised industries, including banking,
telecommunications, and pharmaceuticals.

A number of market factors have increased the need for both
standardising business practices and harmonising regulations to promote
interoperable traceability within the seafood sector. These include:

-   Growing consumer and regulatory demands for more information about
    the origins of seafood products;

-   Rising concerns about the marketing of seafood which is sourced from
    illegal, unsustainable, or socially irresponsible practices
    (including slavery at sea); and

-   Increased business interest in improving transparency within seafood
    supply chains.
