title: Gear Types
description: How to record events based on the different gear types used.
---

Different vessels use different gear types depending on the vessel as well as the commodity being harvested from the wild. In general, we have categorized these different gear types into 2 categories, `continious deployment` and `non-continuous deployment` gear type.

## Continuous Deployment
These are gear types that are deployed continuously for long periods of time such as `trawling`. When recording Fishing Events when this gear type is used, it is recommended that a Fishing Event is recorded for each square kilometer that the gear is deployed and products are being harvested.

## Non-Continuous Deployement
These are gear types that are deployed in a non-continuous manner, such as `hook and line` that are deployed for short period of times and then harvested products are collected. It is recommended that a Fishing Event is recorded for each time the gear is deployed.
