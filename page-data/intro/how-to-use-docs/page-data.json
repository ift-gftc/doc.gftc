These documents are meant for a variety of audiences, but chiefly are intended to instruct IT and supply chain management professionals how to implement their traceability systems to be interoperable across their supply chain partners. The GDST packet includes explanatory materials, normative standards, Key Data Elements Basic Universal List, and technical implementation guidance which are designed to be a flexible extension of EPCIS standards to address use cases in IUU fishing. The explanatory materials explain the background behind seafood traceability system design, the normative standards specify the data and identifer requirements to be GDST compliant, and the technical implementation guidance gives recommended instructions leveraging GS1 standards to ensure interoperability across a variety of data sharing arrangements and data collection technologies."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"In addition to the GDST 1.0 packet materials, the GDST has created this GitHub repository to house additional enhanced documentation.
