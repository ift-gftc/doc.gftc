[Our recommended method for\nsharing is by \"bilaterally pushing\" whole chain traceability EPCIS\nfiles]{.underline} including all relevant master and event data from\none party to another party when product changes hands, as part of an\naudit or to a regulatory body. This assures that the data is\nexchanged knowingly between two parties as part of a legally binding\nagreement. Also, the inclusion of all relevant master data and event\ndata representing each required step in the supply chain provides\nthe receiver with a complete history of the product or products of\ninterest without having to access additional systems or parties.\nHowever, this does put the responsibility of collecting all prior\nevents digitally (CTEs and KDEs) on processors, brokers, importers\nand other links in the supply chain that currently rely heavily on\npaper records. This will require each organization to adopt systems\nthat can collect, store and share both their own event information\nand all prior events. For example, a tuna loin processor would be\nrequired to receive, and store catch details from a vessel operator.\nIn turn, the exporter might need to be able to electronically\nreceive both the catch information and the processing information\nfrom the loin processor.
