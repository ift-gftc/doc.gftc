## Business drivers

### IUU Fishing\[8\]

Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a broad term that
captures a wide variety of fishing activity. IUU fishing is found in all
types and dimensions of fisheries; it occurs both on the high seas and
in areas within national jurisdiction. It concerns all aspects and
stages of the capture and utilization of fish, and it may sometimes be
associated with organized crime. The GDST framework including the Basic
Universal List (BUL) is crafted to collect KDEs at CTEs to provide a
backbone of accountability toward addressing IUU fishing.

  - Illegal Fishing:
    
      - conducted by national or foreign vessels in waters under the
        jurisdiction of a State, without the permission of that State,
        or in contravention of its laws and regulations;
    
      - conducted by vessels flying the flag of States that are parties
        to a relevant regional fisheries management organization but
        operate in contravention of the conservation and management
        measures adopted by that organization and by which the States
        are bound, or relevant provisions of the applicable
        international law; or
    
      - in violation of national laws or international obligations,
        including those undertaken by cooperating States to a relevant
        regional fisheries management organization.

  - Unreported Fishing:
    
      - which have not been reported, or have been misreported, to the
        relevant national authority, in contravention of national laws
        and regulations; or
    
      - are undertaken in the area of competence of a relevant regional
        fisheries management organization which have not been reported
        or have been misreported, in contravention of the reporting
        procedures of that organization.

  - Unregulated Fishing:
    
      - in the area of application of a relevant regional fisheries
        management organization that are conducted by vessels without
        nationality, or by those flying the flag of a State not party to
        that organization, or by a fishing entity, in a manner that is
        not consistent with or contravenes the conservation and
        management measures of that organization; or
    
      - in areas or for fish stocks in relation to which there are no
        applicable conservation or management measures and where such
        fishing activities are conducted in a manner inconsistent with
        State responsibilities for the conservation of living marine
        resources under international law.

IUU fishing undermines national and regional efforts to conserve and
manage fish stocks and, as a consequence, inhibits progress towards
achieving the goals of long-term sustainability and responsibility.
Moreover, IUU fishing greatly disadvantages and discriminates against
those fishers that act responsibly, honestly and in accordance with the
terms of their fishing authorizations. If IUU fishers target vulnerable
stocks that are subject to strict management controls or moratoria,
efforts to rebuild those stocks to healthy levels will not be achieved,
threatening marine biodiversity, food security for communities who rely
on fisheries resources for protein and the livelihoods of those involved
in the sector.

### Seafood Fraud, Substitution and Erroneous Identification\[12\]

  - Seafood Substitution:

> Once fish is filleted and skinned; its species can be difficult to
> determine. Some sellers take advantage of this and substitute a
> low-valued species for a more expensive one (for example, passing off
> catfish as grouper). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted
> DNA testing on fish to determine the accuracy of the market names on
> their labels and found that fish species are correctly labeled 85
> percent of the time.\[13\] Although the `bait and switch` might be the
> most well-known type of seafood fraud, it is not the most common.

  - Seafood Short-Weighing:

> Less known, but far more common, is short-weighting—when processors
> misrepresent the weight of a seafood product through practices such as
> overglazing, soaking, and breading. Processors will often add a layer
> of ice or a preservative to keep a seafood product fresh, a normal and
> legal practice. However, when a processor uses excess ice
> (overglazing) or additives (soaking) and includes that weight with the
> net weight of the seafood, that's fraud. Consumers should pay for the
> weight of the seafood alone. Short-weighting charges consumers more
> for less seafood.

  - Mislabeling:

> Sometimes other qualities of seafood are mislabeled in addition to the
> species name—such as the country of origin—to avoid regulations and
> fees, or even to sneak or launder illegally caught fish into the
> supply chain. This can occur through: Transshipping—when seafood
> products are exported through different countries to avoid duties and
> tariffs. At-sea transfers—when illegal fishing vessels transfer their
> catch to cargo vessels carrying legitimately caught seafood.
> Falsifying trade documents. Mislabeling seafood and concealing
> illegally caught fish evades inspection fees, permits, and other
> business costs that affect the price of responsibly caught seafood.

### Food Safety

> Seafood may be contaminated with a number of contaminants including,
> pathogens (i.e. bacteria, viruses, or parasites), naturally occurring
> poisons and toxins, intentionally introduced chemicals in aquaculture
> and unintentionally introduced chemicals absorbed from the
> environment. In cases of contamination it is important to ascertain
> where seafood came from, to pinpoint the source of the contamination
> and speed the removal from the supply chain.\[14\]

### Sustainability Focused Certification Schemes

> In an effort to assure consumers that the seafood they buy is produced
> in a sustainable way, there are a number of certification schemes in
> the industry that are meant to provide this assurance. Product
> Traceability, Chain of Custody and Mass Balance (matching certified
> quantity to quantity consumed in the marketplace or
> disposed/repurposed along the way) are common requirements across
> these schemes.

## The usage of unique identification for traceable objects

Seafood traceability is often discussed in terms of documents:
purchase orders, catch and landing certificates, packing lists,
invoices, etc. However, to meet the goal of seafood traceability one
should <span class="underline">track the actual seafood</span>\[15\]
from catch to consumption, including changes of custody along the way,
processing performed with input and output quantities (for mass
balance) and any audit, certification, testing or inspection
performed.

<span class="underline">Traceable object identification must be unique
across the global supply chain</span> because the critical tracking
events (CTE’s) that rely on them to connect will not only be shared
between trading partners, but potentially other actors, including
regulators, auditors, importers, and downstream retail customers.
Unique identification is possible through a few mechanisms, but for
ease of implementation and system design we point to three identifier
types (see section 6)

> CTE’s also answer Who, Where, When and Why, but the thing that links
> them together is the What – or traceable objects (seafood).

## The need for interoperability and standards

> The seafood supply chain is composed of thousands of organizations
> worldwide. Each organization is responsible for maintaining
> traceability records internally to meet their own business needs and
> external requirements. Given the scope and scale of the industry, it
> is reasonable to assume that many different software solutions will be
> deployed to identify, capture and share critical tracking events.
> Interoperable traceability standards lower the total cost of ownership
> of traceability solutions, speed implementation and mitigate the
> possibility of near-term technology obsolescence.

## GS1 Standards – base for building interoperable traceability standards and the GDST framework

> The GS1 system of standards includes a globally unique numbering
> scheme for traceable objects and locations; a series of barcodes and
> Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) specifications for Automated
> Identification and Data Capture (AIDC); and a number of standard
> methods for exchanging Master Data, Transaction Data and Event
> Data.\[16\] To assist organizations and industries with traceability
> implementation, GS1 also provides industry guidance and application
> standards for using the suite of GS1 technical standards.\[17\] One
> challenge presented in developing an interoperable framework was
> devising requirements which will be useable and compatible with
> traceability of other food objects at the end of the supply chain
> (i.e. retailers), by which opening GS1 standards for seafood
> traceability.
 
The GS1 Global Traceability Standard framework for interoperable
traceability systems\[18\] provides a framework beginning with:

  - **Core Layer** of Unique Identification and data requirements based
    on GS1 Standards (who, what, when, where, why). For seafood we have
    described these in three ways: common CTEs and KDEs and baseline
    barcode support.

  - **Region specific extensions**. For seafood, Unites States NOAA
    Seafood Import Monitoring Program (SIMP), UK and EU seafood
    regulations; and Port State Measures are considered.

  - **User specific extensions**. For internal traceability, or within a
    specific software or hardware solution provider’s system it is
    sometimes necessary to extend the standard. However, these
    extensions are strongly discouraged where industry-wide
    interoperability is expected.

  - **Note:** The GTS framework supports hybrid implementations where
    GS1 standards are combined with non-GS1 standards or legacy
    solutions. This has enabled us to leverage existing systems and
    identifiers such as URLs and QR codes which are frequently used
    today in seafood traceability.
