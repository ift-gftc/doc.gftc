title: 1. GDST Traceability Overview
---

## Objective

The purpose of this document is to provide the seafood industry with a
simple, flexible, voluntary approach for capturing, storing and sharing
seafood traceability data events. It is not intended to be a standard,
certification scheme or regulation. For ease, we will use the word
`framework` to mean the GDST recommended approach leveraging GS1
standards for interoperability.

## Scope

  - This document contains a general discussion of the drivers for
    seafood traceability and links to important regulators and
    certification schemes.

  - Secondly, and most importantly, this document identifies Critical
    Tracking Events (CTEs) and Key Data Elements (KDEs) that will help
    meet the traceability needs of the many stakeholders in the seafood
    industry.

  - Third, a brief discussion about product identification is included
    to point readers to the various options available for marking
    seafood and containers to enable automated data capture via barcode,
    RFID, Bluetooth and other communication protocols.

  - Finally, this document contains an introduction to electronic file
    formats and data sharing platforms, frameworks and technology â€“
    including blockchain. Links to sample files and more detailed
    guidance are provided as well.
