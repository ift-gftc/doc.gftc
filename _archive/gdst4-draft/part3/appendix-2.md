title: "Appendix 2: Aquaculture Basic Universal List"
---

The Aquaculture (Farmed) BUL tables are broken up into supply chain
roles: Processor, Farm, Hatchery, and Feed. Because of space
limitations, they are broken up by: KDE Definition, Data Format,
Standards Data List and Standards Organization, and List Link,
Authoritative Data Source, and Authoritative Data Document.
