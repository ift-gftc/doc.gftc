## **Appendix Explanation**

Appendix 1 and 2 are adopted version 5’s of the wild-caught and
aquaculture Basic Universal Lists (BULs), respectively. These lists are
referenced in Sections 4 and 5 briefly, but are reproduced here with
their definitions, standard data options, respective standards
organization, link to the standard data options list, authoritative data
source, authoritative data document, data semantics & syntax, data
hierarchy, EPCIS attribute, EPCIS CBV type, and EPCIS CBV description.
\[Note that EPCIS attributes for Aquaculture will be added in Draft 5.\]
These definitions are outlined below:

Note: To permit the printing on standard 8.5` by 11` printer paper, the
secretariat has chosen to break up the tables by major column groupings.
Though this is not ideal, electronic copies are available upon request
for easier reference.
